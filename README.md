I have learned lots and lots of stuff already in computer science. I learned that everything is composed of numbers like the movie the matrix. I also have learned some of the basics of coding. I first learned how to code hello world. Then I learned how to make loops of sounds and all sorts of awesome coding stuff. Then in my second class we started learning how to code using python. It is very confusing for me and I could not figure out the mario assignment but I did try my hardest. I also could not figure out how to do one of those pull request things so I am writing what I have learned here.
I am interested in learning about ways to help the environment and society as a whole. I am currently working on my computer science assignment. My favorite hobby is either thrifting or horseback riding.
